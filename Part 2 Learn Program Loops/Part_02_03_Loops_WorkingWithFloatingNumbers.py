# ---------- WORKING WITH FLOATS ----------
# Floating point numbers are numbers with decimal values
 
your_float = input("Enter a float: ")
 
# We can convert a string into a float like this
 
your_float = int(your_float)
 
# We can define how many decimals are printed being 2
# here by putting :.2 before f
print("Rounded to 2 decimals : {:.2f}".format(your_float))
