# ---------- PROBLEM : PRINT ODDS FROM 1 to 20 ----------
# Use a for loop, range, if and modulus to print out the odds
 
# Use for to loop through the list from 1 to 21
 
for i in range(1, 21):
 
# Use modulus to check that the result is NOT EQUAL to 0
# Print the odds
 
    if ((i % 2) != 0):
        print "i = ", i
